# Fraud-Transcation-Prediction

Project Goal: Develop a predictive model for fraud detection in a financial dataset (CSV, 6,362,620 rows, 10 columns). Utilize model insights to create an actionable plan. This project emphasizes statistical analysis and creative judgment for optimal results in fraud prevention.


## Key Take Away

-Performed a comprehensive analysis and built a fraud detection model using machine learning.
-Importing necessary libraries and conducted data ingestion and validation, including identifying data insights such as imbalanced data and potential fraud indicators.
-Addressed outliers and multicollinearity issues and selected the best numerical features using SelectKBest.
-Preprocessed the data, oversampled and undersampled to handle class imbalance, scaled the data, and selected the top features.
-Finally built, evaluated, and compared five classification models, concluding that the RandomForestClassifier performed the best.
-Concluded it by providing key insights and recommendations for fraud prevention.
